# Python_projects

## Alexa Program
These is a fun Python project which I constructed with the help of Programming Hero : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWvsXxDtEkU. 
I have made some modifications to the original code to add more libraries. Please feel free to take this code and add your modifications. All the best!
